# Portfolio Demo

This is the beginnings of my online portfolio that will house my work to show future employers. 

Displayed on the homepage of this application are the header with my name and navigation bar that will have links to information about me and my work. If the user hovers on the navigation bar elements the text will turn blue and the cursor will turn into a hand. 

Directly below the header is where my most recent project will go. There will be a picture of it, followed by a brief description. If the user hovers over this area, the text will turn blue and the cursor will turn into a hand.

Below this there will be smaller images of other projects I have worked on. Again, if the user hovers over this area, the text will turn blue and the cursor will turn into a hand. I'm not sure why the far right box is not in line with the others.

At the bottom of the page is the footer. 

## Challenges During This Project

I did struggle with this project. I am not totally confident with CSS, so I did reference our bootcamp repo for help in writing my CSS code. 

I will continue to work on this project and hopefully refine its look as well as gain confidence in CSS syntax.

### Technologies Used

VS Code to edit HTML, CSS and README. GitHub to store and publish.
